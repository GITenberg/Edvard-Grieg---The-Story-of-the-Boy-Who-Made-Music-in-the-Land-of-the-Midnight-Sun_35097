<p class="h2">Directions for Binding</p>

<p>Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the
needle with which to bind this book. Start in from
the outside as shown on the diagram here. Pass the
needle and thread through the center of the book,
leaving an end extend outside, then through to the
outside, about 2 inches from the center; then from
the outside to inside 2 inches from the center at the
other end of the book, bringing the thread finally
again through the center, and tie the two ends in a
knot, one each side of the cord on the outside.</p>

<p class="h2">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</p>

<p class="noindent">This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN
BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas
Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers
for Children," "Music Talks with Children," "First
Studies in Music Biography," and others.</p>

<p>The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut
apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its
proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing
the same number as will be found under each picture on the
sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture
with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within
the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic
paste, if possible.</p>

<p>After this play-work is completed there will be found at
the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to
write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts
and questions found on the previous pages.</p>

<p>The book is then to be sewed by the child through the
center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book
thus becomes the child's own book.</p>

<p>This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and
interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main
facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians&mdash;an
educational feature worth while.</p>

<p class="h2">The Story of the Boy Who Made Music<br />
in the Land of the Midnight Sun</p>

<hr />

<p>This is the picture of a boy who was born in the
north of the world. He loved his mother country and
the music which the people sang.</p>

<p>But he had music, all his own, that sang and sang in
his heart. It was happy music and sad; solemn and
joyous. You will hear it some day and love it all.</p>

<p>Even when this little boy was in the primary school
the music knocked at his heart's door as if it would say:</p>

<p>"Let me out into the world so that people may
hear me."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus02.png" alt="No. 2" title="No. 2" /><br />
<span class="caption">GRIEG AS A BOY</span>
</div>

<p>When he was twelve years old he started out one
morning as usual, but instead of taking his school
books he took with him his music writing book which
contained what he termed "Variation on a German
Melody Op. 1."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus03.png" alt="No. 3" title="No. 3" /><br />
<span class="caption">FROM THE NORWEGIAN BRIDAL PROCESSION <a href="music/grieg03.mid">Listen</a></span>
</div>

<p>Can you not imagine how proud he must have been
of his Op. 1?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus04.png" alt="No. 4" title="No. 4" /><br />
<span class="caption">GRIEG&#39;S SIGNATURE</span>
</div>

<p>His schoolmates were very proud to see the music
of their companion Edvard. But alas! While they
were looking at it and talking about it, whom do you
think came creeping up behind them?</p>

<p>Why, the schoolmaster, to be sure.</p>

<p>He gave little Edvard a rough shaking up and told
him how severely he would be punished if ever again
he brought such nonsense to school.</p>

<p>Poor old schoolmaster! He did not know what
Edvard Grieg would one day mean to the land and
people of Norway. For Edvard loved not only the
music that kept singing in him, but he loved Norway
and all its people. Do you think any one could help
loving such mountains as these?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus05.png" alt="No. 5" title="No. 5" /><br />
<span class="caption">NORWEGIAN MOUNTAIN SCENE</span>
</div>

<p>But all the grown up folks of Edvard's world did
not call his music rubbish. His mother loved music
and played beautifully. It was
from her that Edvard had his
first lessons, just as Mendelssohn
was first taught by his mother.</p>

<p>Then one day something
wonderful happened. A great
violinist, Ole Bull by name, visited
the Grieg family in the country.
He was so kind to the little
composer that the boy just loved
him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus06.png" alt="No. 6" title="No. 6" /><br />
<span class="caption">OLE BULL</span>
</div>

<p>Ole Bull had traveled the world over playing the
violin. He looked over Edvard's compositions and
made the boy play them to him. You can see him
nodding his head in pleasure as he listens. His fine
eyes are lighted up. He tells the boy composer that
his music is quite good, but that there is a lot for him
to learn yet. So he must study earnestly and make
many sacrifices.</p>

<p>Then Ole Bull sits down and talks with Father
and Mother Grieg. It is a serious talk, as one can
see. Finally, when the talk is finished, Ole Bull takes
the wondering boy by the hand and says to him:</p>

<p>"You are going to Leipzig to study and become a
fine musician."</p>

<p>So Edvard Grieg left his home city, Bergen, its
mountains, its fjords, its people, his father and mother,
and traveled south through Norway, across the
water and into Germany. No doubt he was a lonesome
boy. Life had become serious all at once and
there was much to be done.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus07.png" alt="No. 7" title="No. 7" /><br />
<span class="caption">BERGEN FJORD</span>
</div>

<p>It was all strange and new. Instead of hills and
the waters of the fjords, there were tall, dark houses,
gloomy streets, and such a lot of hurrying people.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus08.png" alt="No. 8" title="No. 8" /><br />
<span class="caption">SCENE IN LEIPZIG</span>
</div>

<p>But he soon grew used to it all and was busy as
could be with lessons in piano and harmony. Just as
in the earlier days in school, so in Leipzig, Edvard
wrote music as it sounded in his heart. In the harmony
lessons he could not make himself write plain
chords to the bass which was given him as an exercise.
He wrote the light, airy, lovely, fanciful tunes and
rhythms that were singing
within him. And just like
the schoolmaster at home,
the harmony teacher
shouted at him, saying:</p>

<p>"No, that is all wrong!"</p>

<p>His harmony teacher
was E. F. Richter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus09.png" alt="No. 9" title="No. 9" /><br />
<span class="caption">E. F. RICHTER</span>
</div>

<p>But you remember that
Ole Bull understood the
boy's music. While here
in Leipzig there were many
who understood it too.</p>

<p>Bit by bit Edvard made friends who loved to listen
to his pieces. One of them was Niels Gade, a fine
musician in Denmark, who was a friend of Schumann's,
who one time, wrote a Northern Song on the
letters on Gade's name. It begins like this:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus10.png" alt="No. 10" title="No. 10" /><br />
<span class="caption">GADE&#39;S MUSICAL NAME <a href="music/grieg10.mid">Listen</a></span>
</div>

<p>And Edvard too once wrote a fugue on the letters
G-A-D-E.</p>

<p>So inspiring was his music study that Edvard
worked very hard. He composed a great deal of
music which slowly made friends for him. Robert
Schumann was one who spoke kindly of the young
Norwegian and his music. And so he grew and improved.
Because he was true to his talent, he made
many friends not only in Leipzig but throughout
Europe, as we shall see.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">R. SCHUMANN</span>
</div>

<p>You will learn some day the names of many of
the people who became friends of Grieg. There
were Rikard Nordraak, and later on Franz Liszt.
Grieg became one of the group of great Norwegian
artists in which Henrik Ibsen and Bjornstjerne Bjornson
were prominent. Indeed, Grieg wrote the music
to Ibsen's <i>Peer Gynt</i>. One of the great pleasures of
Grieg's life was Bjornson's <i>Patriotic Poem</i> to his
own music.</p>

<span class="caption">BJORNSON</span>
</div>

<p>One day Grieg showed Gade a composition called
<i>In Autumn</i> which Gade did not like. "It is too Norwegian,"
he said. This pleased Grieg, although Gade
told him to go home and write something better. He
was nearly as rough as Grieg's schoolmaster.</p>

<p>But one day later a prize was offered in Sweden
for an orchestral composition. Grieg's <i>In Autumn</i>
won the prize. And Gade was one of the judges. We
wonder if he forgot about it!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus16.png" alt="No. 16" title="No. 16" /><br />
<span class="caption">GADE</span>
</div>

<p>Grieg married his cousin Mina Hagerup, to whom
he dedicated his famous song: <i>I Love Thee</i>. But the
mother of his bride did not think highly of him.</p>

<p>"He is a nobody," she said, "who writes music that
no one cares to listen to."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus17.png" alt="No. 17" title="No. 17" /><br />
<span class="caption">GRIEG AND HIS WIFE</span>
</div>

<p>But people were beginning to listen. After a concert
in Christiania, entirely of Norwegian music, the
Government gave Grieg a small pension and he went
to Rome.</p>

<p>Here he had a fine meeting with Liszt who asked
Grieg to play. Then Liszt took Grieg's manuscript
and played it at sight, to his great delight.</p>

<p>When Grieg bade good-bye to Liszt the famous
pianist said to him:</p>

<p>"Keep on, you have talent and ability. Do not let
any one discourage or frighten you."</p>

<p>So sensitive was Grieg about music writing that
he never allowed any one to watch him. So he had a
little house built in the mountains where he could
work at his leisure. This he called his "tune house."
There was only one room and it was for all the world
like a little play house that children have. In it was
his piano and often when he was playing, the Norwegian
peasants used to group themselves outside the
door, sometimes joining in the singing, and then again
dancing to their delightful folktunes and dances.</p>

<p>As a boy in Leipzig he worked too hard and sickness
made it necessary for him to return home. From
this sickness he never fully recovered. All his life he
was frail and unable to endure severe tasks.</p>

<p>In appearance Grieg was short and rather bent in
figure. His hands were thin, but fine and strong for
the piano, although one of them had been crushed in
an accident. His eyes were deep blue. They looked
straight at you and were full of life and kindness.</p>

<p>Grieg was merry of nature; a lovely companion,
full of fun and company. Sometimes, however, he
was sad and melancholy like his own music.</p>

<p>Some day you will learn the names of many of his
compositions. And among them you will love such
pieces as <i>The Birds</i>, <i>In Spring Time</i>, <i>Arietta</i>, the <i>Peer
Gynt Music</i>, the <i>Piano Sonata</i>, the <i>Piano and Violin
Sonata</i>, and lots of lively Norwegian dances and
tunes. Indeed, he has composed many compositions
which you will number among your favorite pieces.</p>

<p>Three great names stand out more than all others
in the musical history of Scandinavia. You have
learned two, Edvard Grieg and Ole Bull. The other
is Jenny Lind, known as "the Swedish nightingale,"
who was loved not only for her wonderful voice but
for her kindness and noble nature. She was born at
Stockholm in 1820 and died in England in 1887. In
Sweden to this day Jennie Lind is a great national
personage. The people look upon her as we would
on Washington, Irving, Lincoln or Longfellow. She
was very beautiful.</p>

<p>Here is her picture.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
